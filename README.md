  ## OVERVIEW:
   The back end api of a product inventory database. his will act as the inventory management system for a front end website. This is the initial structure for a robust system that can track inventory in various ways. Even fairly simple database structures can handle large amounts of information if they are constructed properly.

  ## Installation
  his project uses nodejs, express router, seqelize as an ORM to interact with the mysql database. Once there is a front end, all of the interaction should be opaque and self-sustaining.

  ## Usage
  Without the front end, interaction is most easily handled through Insomnia at the localhost on port 3011.

  ## Tests
  No custom tests, verification was handled through Insomnia.

  ## Credits
  Many thanks to the creators of js, node, express, mysql, insomnia and all of the dependencies without which coding would take a very long time indeed.
